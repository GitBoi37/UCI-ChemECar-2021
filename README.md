# UCIChemECar2021
Repository created by Lance to centralize code storage and stop google docs
If one of the scripts doesn't work, specifically one using the DFRobot library, install necessary libraries
Some libraries can be found in the libraries folder, some others may be required

test_DFRobot has worked the best so far
test_getRawData is definitely broken for the old sensor for some reason
test_getRGB is not broken for any sensors, unsure of working status
